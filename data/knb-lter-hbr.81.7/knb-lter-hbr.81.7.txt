Dataset Abstract

	Bird abundances have been determined from timed
      censuses, territory maps and nest locations at the Hubbard
      Brook Experimental Forest from 1969 to the present. This data
      set includes counts of the number of adult birds (males and
      females) per 10 ha at HBEF (1969 - present) and on three
      additional plots within the White Mountain National Forest
      (1986 - 2000).
	These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook
      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at
      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and
      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research
      Station.
