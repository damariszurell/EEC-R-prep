#' "Descriptive statistics and random numbers"

#' 
#' Statistics are at the heart of R and probably the reason why I learned this language in the first place. Here, I will just provide a brief overview of descriptive summary statistics, probability distributions, and random numbers. I don't introduce simple linear regression here as we will do a lot of regression in the other weeks.
#' 
#' # 1 - Descriptive statistics
#' These describe data samples, for example the central tendency, spread and variance, or relationships in cases of bi- or multivariate data.
#' 
#' Important functions to know for first and second order moments are:
#' 
#' - `mean(x)`, `weighted.mean(x)`, `median(x)` : arithmetic mean, weighted mean, and median of a vector (here: x)
#' - `quantile(x, probs = p)` : the p% quantile of vector x
#' - `sd(x)`, `var(x)`: standard deviation, and variance (both with denominator n-1)
#' - `mad(x)` : median absolute deviation
#' - `range(x)` : minimum and maximum values
#' - `diff(range(x))` : spread
#' - `diff(quantile(x,c(0.25,0.75)))` : interquartile range
#' - `cor(x,y)`, `cov(x,y)` : correlation coefficient, and covariance

 
#' # 2 - Probability distribution and random numbers
#' R offers several built-in probability distributions, which usually come with four functions: probability density function (prefix `d` for density), cumulative distribution function (prefix `p` for probability), a function for calculating quantiles (prefix `q` for quantiles) and a function for generating (pseudo-) random numbers (prefix `r` for random).
#' 
#' Have a look at the help pages to find all the built-in distributions: `?Distributions`
#' 
#' Letâ€™s have a look at the normal distribution. As default, R assumes the standard normal distribution with `mean=0` and `sd=1`. We first look at the probability density function. This shows us the probability (or relative likelihood) that a random sample from a population (or the sample space) takes a specific value.
x <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.5)

# the standard normal distribution
curve(dnorm(x), -3, 6, lwd = 2, xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", ylim = c(0, 0.5)) #plots density function

# changing the parameters for mean and sd
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2), -3, 6, col = "red", add = TRUE, lwd = 2) 
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 2), -3, 6, col = "green", add = TRUE, lwd = 2)

#' 
#' We see that the shape and the location of the bell curve changes according to the parameters `mean` and `sd`. So, what is the probability that a random sample from the different populations (the differently coloured bell curves in this case) take the value `x=0`?
#' 
# look at black curve in above plot:
dnorm(0)

# look at red curve in above plot:
dnorm(0, 2)

# look at green curve in above plot:
dnorm(0, 2, 2) 

#' 
#' We can also draw random numbers from these distributions using the function `rnorm()`.
#' ?dnorm
# draw 10 random numbers from the standard normal distribution:
rnorm(10)

par(mfrow=c(1,3)) 
# plot the density function
curve(dnorm(x), -3, 6, lwd = 2, ylim = c(0, 0.5), xlim=c(-5,10)) 
# draw random numbers and plot as histogram
hist(rnorm(1000), freq = FALSE, col = NULL, add = TRUE) 

# change parameter mean 
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2), -3, 6, col = "red", lwd = 2,  ylim = c(0, 0.5), xlim=c(-5,10)) 
hist(rnorm(1000, mean=2), freq=FALSE, col=NULL,  add=TRUE) 

# change parameters mean and sd 
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 2), -3, 6, col = "green", lwd = 2,  ylim = c(0, 0.5), xlim=c(-5,10))
hist(rnorm(1000, mean=2, sd=2), freq=FALSE, col=NULL, add=TRUE)

#' 
#' **Extra:** Also have a look at the cumulative density function `pnorm()` and the quantile function `qnorm()`.
#'

#' # 3 - Draw samples
#' Another very useful feature is that we can draw samples from a vector using `sample()`. As arguments, it takes a scalar or vector from which to draw, and the number of samples to draw. Per default, samples are drawn without replacement.
sample(1:30, size = 20) # without replacement
sample(30, size = 20) # same
sample(1:30, size = 20, replace = TRUE) # with replacement
sample(letters, 10)
